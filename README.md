# Synapse
With the US Pentagon's soon to be released report on Aliens... A GAME ABOUT ALIENS in a low poly 50s style... and yeah, cows have far superior brain matter to study.

Play the current version here: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/synapse-g

The current iteration of Synapse serves as a tech demo to demostrate player movement and primary game objectives (time limits, and collection goals) that will be used as the game development progresses.

Looking forward, I plan to see Synapse expand into features as listed bellow:
- Multiple Levels, with varying geography and infrastructure that challenge the player's mobility.
- Refine Time Management into the most crucial player resource
  - reward a great performance
  - mistakes are devistating
- A Secondary Competitor that challenges the player to meet their collection goal before available collection-items are stolen.
- Obstacle Navigation Challenge increases as players progress through the levels with the introduction of new "Enemy Weapons"
- Rare collectables that hansomly reward the player in their playthrouhg.


I want the game to be an easy to grasp concept and a very smooth experience that caters to the speedrunners, completionists, and Secret-Hunters
Heres how I'll do this:
- The game is designed to be realitively short with a current maximum of 7 levels (may be reduced at release).
- There will be no level select; How far you get is specific to that run. If you lose, you start over again.
- Rare/Hard to find items will be hidden on maps and are highly rewarding to the playthrough... if you find them.
- The main menu will have a list of objectives to complete with increasing difficulty 
  - List of secondary tasks
  - List of rare items collected
  - A log of discovered eastereggs
