# Synapse
With the US Pentagon's soon to be released report on Aliens... A GAME ABOUT ALIENS in a low poly 50s style... and yeah, cows have far superior brain matter to study.

Play the current version here: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/synapse-g

The current iteration of Synapse serves as a tech demo to demostrate player movement and primary game objectives (time limits, and collection goals) that will be used as the game development progresses.

Looking forward, I plan to see it expand into features listed bellow:
- Multiple Levels, with varying geography and infrastructure.
- Refine Time Management as the most crucial resource to the player 
  - rewarding them for great performance, and mistakes will be devistating)
-
